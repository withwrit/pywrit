"""pywrit — Python client for Writ, the gate before the write.

Put a policy gate in front of your agent's dangerous actions:

    from pywrit import WritClient

    client = WritClient(api_key="writ_...")
    result = client.check(
        sponsor_id="acme",
        agent_id="agent-7",
        verb="db.write",
        target="prod.customers",
        purpose="backfill region field",
    )
    if result.decision == "ALLOW":
        ...  # perform the write, result.auth_token proves it was gated
    elif result.decision == "STEP_UP":
        ...  # a human sponsor must approve via client.grant(...)
